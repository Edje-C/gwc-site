  <b>A Woman Who Inspires Me Everyday</b>
  <ul>
    <li>My mother inspires me everyday to become the best that I could be.  She is my motivator, helper, mentor, and best friend.  Even though she immigrated to the United States from Ecuador at age 19, she showed me that there are endless possibilites to learn and grow.  She plays the role of both mother and father to my sister and I and she never fails to care for our needs.  Most importantly, she loves us no matter what.  You see, even though I sometimes disappoint her, I know she'll always be there for me.  She is a selfless, fearless, and a hard working woman who puts the needs of others before her own.  Words cannot describe the amount of honor and love I have for my mother.  She is truly my inspiration and heroe.   </li>
